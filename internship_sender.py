My name is Husam, and I'm a 23-year-old student about to graduate from MMU with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Cyber Security and Networks.

I am confident in my skills and fully prepared to excel in technical interviews. Unlike many students who submit their CVs and wait, I actively pursue opportunities because I do not have the luxury of failure.

Please take a look at my attached resume and reference letter. If my profile resonates with your needs, I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Best regards,  
Husam Al-howbani
