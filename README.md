+ Safety First: Includes a safety prompt before sending to prevent accidental mass emails.

+ Dry Run & Test Modes: Allows you to test the script without sending real emails or to send to a test email address.

### üöÄ Usage
+ To run the script, open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

      python internship_sender.py

+ A safety prompt will appear asking for confirmation before sending. Type y and press enter to proceed.

+ The script will print real-time status updates to the console for each email sent or skipped.

+ Once completed, a log file named sent_log.csv will be created in the directory, which you can open with Excel or a similar program to review the results.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
+ Be mindful of email sending limits. Sending too many emails in a short period might flag your account as spam.

+ Customize the subject and body to fit your needs. The provided text is a starting point.

+ The script assumes your Excel file has columns named exactly as specified in the code. Adjust the column names in the script if yours are different.
